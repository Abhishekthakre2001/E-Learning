<h1>PHP Variables</h1>
<pre>
  In PHP, a variable is declared using a $ sign followed by the variable name.
   Here, some important points to know about variables:

      * As PHP is a loosely typed language, so we do not need to declare the data types of the variables.
      * It automatically analyzes the values and makes conversions to its correct datatype.
      * After declaring a variable, it can be reused throughout the code.
      * Assignment Operator (=) is used to assign the value to a variable.

  Syntax of declaring a variable in PHP is given below: 
  <div class="variable">
    $variablename=value;  
    </div>
   Rules for declaring PHP variable:

       * A variable must start with a dollar ($) sign, followed by the variable name.
       * It can only contain alpha-numeric character and underscore (A-z, 0-9, _).
       * A variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_) character.
       * A PHP variable name cannot contain spaces.
       * One thing to be kept in mind that the variable name cannot start with a number or special symbols.
       * PHP variables are case-sensitive, so $name and $NAME both are treated as different variable.
